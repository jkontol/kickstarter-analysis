# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on various types of theater Kickstarters to uncover trends.

Based on our data it is recommended that Louise choose musicals or plays as her focus. If she choses to create crowdfunding for a musical in Great Britain it is best to keep funding under $4,000.
