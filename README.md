# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Help Louise, who is an up and coming playwright, start her crowdfunding campaign to fund her play title "Fever". Her budget is estimated at over $10,000 
### Purpose
To analyze crowdfunding data to help her gain a better understanding of what factors make up successful campaigns. 
## Analysis and Challenges
We will look at various catagories and subcategories of campaigns as well as timing. These analysis will help us show Louise which factors have a greater impact on her future campaign. We were able to assess that campaigns in the theater parent category were the most successful. Plays are a subcategory of theater putting "Fever" in a good spot. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May seems to be the peak time to launch a successful campaign. There was a significant spike during May, and June was the 2nd highest month. These months would be the ideal time of the year to seek funding for her play Fever.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Funding for "Fever" is greater than $10,000. If Louise stays in that range from $10,000 to %15,000 less than 60% of campaigns have been successful. For the greatest chance of success it is best to either aim low at $1000 or less giving a 76% success rate or go up to $35,000 which has a 67% success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were some challenges converting the Unix Timestamps, but we were able to pull out the year and months to complete our analysis. It was also necessary to break out Parent Categories and subcategories to drill down to the best solutions specific to the play.  


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- May is a good month to launch a play. 
- June would be the 2nd best month. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From $20,000 to $30,000 there is a significantly large number of failed campaigns. There are only a few sweet spots to give "Fever" a better chance. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The larger the dataset, the better chance of getting a clear picture of potential outcomes. This data is limited due to the size. 
How were these campaigns promoted? It would be nice to have a view of how the message was delivered, and if certain social media outlets were more successful. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The percentage of failures and successful campaigns by year. This could be a historical graph
A look at play success by locations. Are certain locations more successful.
